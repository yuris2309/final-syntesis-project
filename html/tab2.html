<h3>What is the Dark matter?</h3>
<p>
  Dark matter is a type of matter present in the universe that does not emit
  light and cannot be directly detected, although its presence can be inferred
  from the gravitational effects it exerts on other celestial bodies. This
  invisible matter makes up about 84% of the matter in the universe, which means
  that there is five times more dark matter than visible matter. Most
  astronomers believe that dark matter is made up of subatomic particles called
  WIMPS (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles). These particles have not yet
  been discovered, although scientists suspect that they are present in the
  universe.

  Physicists first theorized the existence of matter in 1933, in part because
  the dark manifestations showed that there was not enough observable matter in
  galaxies to keep them from falling apart

  Today it is known that dark matter is made up of particles that do not absorb,
  reflect or emit light, so they cannot be detected by observing electromagnetic
  radiation. This, together with dark energy, makes up practically 95% of the
  universe. Astronomers were able to figure out where it is because it distorts
  the light from distant stars.
