<h3>Radiation of the universe</h3>
<p>
  Radiation from the universe refers to the electromagnetic radiation found
  everywhere in the universe that originated shortly after the Big Bang, when
  the universe was very young and hot. This radiation is called cosmi c
  microwave background (CMB) radiation, and it is detected in all directions of
  the sky. The cosmic microwave background radiation is the result of the
  release of photons that occurred when the universe was only a few hundred
  thousand years old. At that time, the universe was in a state of high energy
  and density, and the photons were trapped in a hot, dense plasma. As the
  universe expanded and cooled, photons were released from the plasma and began
  traveling through intergalactic space. Today, these photons are part of the
  radiation background that is detected in all directions of the sky. The
  discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation in the 1960s was a major
  milestone in cosmology, as it provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory
  and allowed scientists to measure density fluctuations in the early universe
  that gave lead to the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures.
