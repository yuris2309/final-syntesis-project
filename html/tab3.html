<h3>What is the Radiation of the universe?</h3>
<p>
  Radiation from the universe refers to the electromagnetic radiation found
  everywhere in the universe that originated shortly after the Big Bang, when
  the universe was very young and hot. This radiation is called cosmic microwave
  background (CMB) radiation, and it is detected in all directions of the sky.
  The cosmic microwave background radiation is the result of the release of
  photons that occurred when the universe was only a few hundred thousand years
  old. At that time, the universe was in a state of high energy and density, and
  the photons were trapped in a hot, dense plasma.

  As the universe expanded and cooled, photons were released from the plasma and
  began traveling through intergalactic space. Today, these photons are part of
  the radiation background that is detected in all directions of the sky. The
  discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation in the 1960s was a major
  milestone in cosmology, as it provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory
  and allowed scientists to measure density fluctuations in the early universe
  that gave lead to the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures.

  Radioactivity was discovered by the French scientist Antoine Henri Becquerel
  in 1896 almost occasionally when conducting research on the fluorescence of
  double sulfate of uranium and potassium. He discovered that uranium
  spontaneously gave off a mysterious radiation.
